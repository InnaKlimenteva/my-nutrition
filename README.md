The **Nutrition Analysis App** is a web-based application that allows users to analyze the nutritional content of food products by entering the quantity and type of food items. The app fetches nutritional data from the Edamam API and presents detailed nutritional information, such as calories, proteins, fats, carbs, and more.

## Features

- **Real-time Results**: Instantaneous response with detailed analysis of the food items.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive interface for easy interaction.
- **Loader State**: Displays a loading screen while fetching data.
